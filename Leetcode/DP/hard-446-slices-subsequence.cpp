/*
Description :
Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
