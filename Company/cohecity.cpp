Que : 1
A pattern string is consisting of only two characters : '0' or '1'.
'0' : Indicates, it will be vowel, vowel are (a,e,i,o,u,y)
'1' : Indicates, it will be consonant, all excel above vowel.
 
Text string consists of lower-case english characters. We need to return the number of times, the pattern matches with
the substring of the text string.

Logic : Check from each index, and move forward like sliding window.


Que : 2
Given a directed adjacency graph of n nodes, we need to find the shortest distance starting from '0' to 'n-1' node.
We have initially full tank of our vehicle and we are standing at '0'th station. Our fuel will decrease by the cost of edge.
You can atmost refill your whole tank at one node. We have given separate array indicating which nodes have fuel station.

Logic : 0/1 BFS or Dijkstra algo
