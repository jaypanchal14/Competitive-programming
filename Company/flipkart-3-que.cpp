/*
1) Given total 10 set of coins, return how many minimum coins you require to sum up to given target amount.
Only constraint is we have 100 coins of same amount, for all coins.
(Greedy approach)

2) Given an array of positive integers, if the subarray sum is equal to target, return true, or return false.

3) Given a string made-up of only 'X','Y' or 'Z' characters. You can replace X with YY, or replace YY with X.
Return smallest possible lexicographically string after performing 0 or more replacing operations.
