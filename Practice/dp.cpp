/*
In order to solve DP problems, we need to hold a good sense of recursion relations/functions.
It can be solved in two ways:
1) Top to bottom : Using recursion and memoization
2) Bottom to up  : Tabulation

At last, we should also check for the space optimization if possible

Order of defining the solution:

1)Prepare base case
2)Rull-out the negative cases
3)Execute based on recursion function
